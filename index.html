                    <p>Richard Phillips Feynman (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American
                        theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics,
                        the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid
                        helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For
                        contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in
                        Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.

                        Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions
                        describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams.
                        During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999
                        poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked the
                        seventh-greatest physicist of all time.[2]</p>

                <p>The wet season (sometimes called the rainy season) is the time of year when most of a region's
                    average annual rainfall occurs. Generally, the season lasts at least a month.[1] The term green
                    season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.[2] Areas with wet seasons are
                    dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.[</p>

                        season leads to food shortages in the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.</p>

                <p>Gell-Mann was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1951,[3] and a visiting
                    research professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1952 to 1953.[18] He was a
                    visiting associate professor at Columbia University and an associate professor at the University of
                    Chicago in 1954–1955 before moving to the California Institute of Technology, where he taught from
                    1955 until he retired in 1993.[19]

                <p>Cows calve, or give birth, at the beginning of the wet season.[48] The onset of the rainy season
                    signals the departure of the monarch butterfly from Mexico.[49] Tropical species of butterflies show
                    larger dot markings on their wings to fend off possible predators and are more active during the wet
                    season than the dry season.[50] Within the tropics and warmer areas of the subtropics, decreased
                    salinity of near shore wetlands due to the rains causes an increase in crocodile nesting.[51] Other
                    species, such as the arroyo toad, spawn within the couple of months after the seasonal rains.[52]
                    Armadillos and rattlesnakes seek higher ground.[53]</p>
